Hurray! You just created a Firebase named 'quickdelivery' - your data will be located at:

    https://quickdelivery.firebaseio.com/

To get started, you'll need to include this snippet of JavaScript in the <head> tag of your web pages:

    <script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/v0/firebase.js"></script>

You can then write data into Firebase like this:

    var dataRef = new Firebase("https://quickdelivery.firebaseio.com");
    dataRef.set("I am now writing data into Firebase!");
